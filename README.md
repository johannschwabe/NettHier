# NettHier

An experimental wake word detector for the ESP32-S3, designed for voice-activated hardware control.

- 🧠 **Wake Word Detection**: Custom neural network trained from scratch using open-source text corpora, fine-tuned with personal voice samples  
- ⚙️ **Servo Integration**: Includes code to control a servo motor based on voice activation  
- 🎯 **Project Goal**: A "Treasure Box" that unlocks via a voice command

## Current Status

- ✅ Neural network trained  
- ✅ Servo mechanism operational  

## Work In Progress

- 🚧 Deploying the trained model to the ESP32-S3  
- 🧰 3D modeling and printing of the box and locking mechanism  
- 🔬 Functional testing and tuning
